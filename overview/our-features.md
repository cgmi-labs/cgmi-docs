# âœ¨ Our Features

## Feature 1 - Explore

**Explore** is designed around the seller's License trading marketplace. NFT Holders have the ability to set prices for their NFT licenses based on various use-cases and list them for sale on the public market.&#x20;

Buyers can choose NFTs they are interested in and purchase the licenses.&#x20;

The payment from the buyer is made in a single installment, while the seller receives earnings incrementally over a specified timeline.

## Feature 2 - Wish

**Wish** is tailored to the buyer's License trading needs. Buyers can craft a 'Wish' list, detailing the purpose, quantity, and total compensation proposed.&#x20;

NFT Holders can contribute their NFT Licenses to the 'Wish' list, making them accessible for buyer selection.&#x20;

Once a substantial number of sellers have engaged, the buyer can cherry-pick their favored NFTs for finalization.&#x20;

The buyer is obligated to remit the full payment upfront, while the seller accrues earnings progressively over a designated timeline.

## Feature 3 - Recreate

**Recreate** is a platform for showcasing derivative works, originating from X (the original Twitter). All users are encouraged to contribute Twitter links of captivating NFT derivative creations to Recreate.&#x20;

We aspire for the **Recreate** to serve as a wellspring of creative inspiration for a broader audience.

## Feature 4 - Scenario

**Scenario** is a dedicated space for highlighting a diverse range of business partnerships. Historically, this information has been fragmented, despite its critical importance in illustrating the dynamism of the NFT community and its boundless potential for the future.&#x20;

Both individual users and enterprises are encouraged to feature their business case studies within the **Scenario**. This will enhance the visibility of the substantial commercial value inherent in Web3 IPs and actively promote license transactions.
