## What is CGMI

CGMI is a platform dedicated to NFT license transactions, aiming to facilitate license transactions between enterprises requiring Web3 NFT licenses and NFT project parties/Holders.&#x20;

Building upon the foundation of peer-to-peer license transactions initiated by seller listings, we have developed a demand pool creation system - Wish to solicit NFTs from sellers based on buyer requirements. CGMI prides itself on its safety and efficiency.&#x20;

Throughout the entire transaction process, the ownership and functionalities of the NFT remain unaffected, ensuring a streamlined and expedited transaction experience.

Moreover, CGMI is committed to fostering the NFT community by offering secondary creation and commercial case display features for all participating collections.
