# üç≠ Creator Earning Plan

We hope to build a strong NFT community and NFT ecosystem together with NFT project parties, and we also welcome high-quality NFT projects to join CGMI to achieve more NFT business cooperation and expand the boundaries of NFT commercialization.&#x20;

For this purpose, we have launched an incentive program for NFT project creators. We will extract a portion of the fees from NFT License transactions and give it to the corresponding NFT Project, automatically implemented through smart contracts.&#x20;

After an NFT Collection is listed on CGMI, it can enjoy **5%** of Creator Earning.
